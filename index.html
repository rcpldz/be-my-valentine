            <p>Hello, my beloved future wife 😊,<br><br>
            It breaks my heart that I can’t be there to ask you this in person, so I made this just for you instead.<br>
            <strong>I love you so much</strong>, and nothing would make me happier than having you as my Valentine. <br><br>
            I know things have been tough, but I promise you—<strong>I will do whatever it takes to build the future we dream of together</strong>. You are my happiness, my love, and my everything.<br><br>
            <strong>I love you more than words can say… (so please say yes! 😆💕)</strong></p>
